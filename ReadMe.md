# Source of my blog

It will be automatically transformed by [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) into a static site, whenever I push this repository to GitHub.

## List of advantages

- Author your posts locally in Markdown format. 
- Blog should be easily stylable and customizable any way I please. 
- It should take care of creating a feed for me. 
- And most of all, my site should be stored on GitHub so that I never lose data again.
