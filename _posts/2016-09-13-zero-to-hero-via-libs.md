## From Zero to Hero via open source libs

Over these years, I have seen explosion of open source libraries. There is no dearth of good
open source libraries. You need to connect these as dots & build your own picture. I make a 
promise to myself not to write code that has already been written & proven.

### Do I need to build a frontend everytime for a new app ?

- Do I need to learn & relearn javascript frameworks ?
- Do you feel markdowns have changed the way people are contributing to writing blogs ? 
  - Do they bother anymore about their article's look & feel ?
  - You want something for similar to your backend app.

  - Decouples multiple backends from frontend.
  - Thinking multi-language backends. No problems.
