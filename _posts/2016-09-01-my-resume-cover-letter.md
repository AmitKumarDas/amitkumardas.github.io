title: Who Am I ?

##  AMIT KUMAR DAS

I have elaborated my current profile which in correlates my area of interest & provides
a fair glimpse of my personality.

> I specialize in designing & building software solutions, improving them, or simply
refactoring them to isolated but cohesive features communicating in harmony. However,
I firmly believe above skills does not have a profound impact until those are read,
understood, apprecitated & criticized by a larger community. Hence my belief in 
*`Literate Programming`*. I conclude by accepting the fact that any solution can stand
the test of time if & only if it is *`simple`*.


Currently designing solutions around the management pieces of file systems 
(read ZFS, [OpenEBS](https://github.com/openebs/) based block storages) & finding 
suitable ways to orchestrate from IaaS frameworks or containers (Jails, LXC, Docker, 
Runc, Kubernetes, etc.). 

<br />

### My hands on

As part of implementing software pieces, I use a variety of programming 
languages, libraries, tools as & when applicable. I am fascinated by functional 
languages and the novelty they provide while thinking through any software puzzle.
In short, I fulfill the role of a full stack / polygot programmer, designer & thinker.

### When I wear my `devops` hat

I have recently been trying to hack into the world of `Devops` and 
`Automation Everywhere`, as one of my generalist roles in my current place of work 
(which is a storage startup).

Below are my hands-on that try to convey my positioning w.r.t automation everywhere
(i.e. either create or exploit an existing tool).

These are specific to `creation of tool`.

- [Introduction](https://github.com/CloudByteStorages/automation-core/blob/master/README.md),
- [Conclusion](https://github.com/CloudByteStorages/automation-core/blob/master/touchstone/DesignThoughts/My%20Final%20Thoughts.md)

<br />

### Some of my stories while in startup:

- [Learnings being with a startup](https://amitkumardas.github.io/2016/08/20/lessons-learned-at-CloudByte.html)
- [Being idiomatic](https://amitkumardas.github.io/2016/08/19/being-idiomatic-and-do-i-bother.html)
- [On Being Functional](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/being-functional-amit-kumar-das?trk=hp-feed-article-title-publish)

behavior.
