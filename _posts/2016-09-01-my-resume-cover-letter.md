I have elaborated my current profile which in correlates to my area of interest.

> I specialize in designing & building software solutions, improving them, or simply
> refactoring them to isolated but cohesive features communicating in harmony.

I am passionate about micro-frameworks and the way these libraries can be curried to 
achieve a greater purpose.

Currently designing solutions around the management pieces of file systems 
(read ZFS, [OpenEBS](https://github.com/openebs/) based block storages) & finding 
suitable ways to orchestrate from IaaS frameworks or containers (Jails, LXC, Docker, Runc, etc.). 

<br />

### My hands on

As part of implementing software pieces, I use a variety of programming 
languages, libraries, tools as & when applicable. I am fascinated by functional 
languages and the novelty they provide while thinking through any software puzzle.
In short, I fulfill the role of a full stack / polygot programmer, designer & thinker.

### When I wear my devops hat

I have recently been trying to hack into the world of Devops and Automation, as one of
my generalist roles in my current place of work (which is a storage startup).

Below are my thoughts that try to convey my positioning w.r.t the world of automata (i.e. create or exploit a tool):

- [Introduction](https://github.com/CloudByteStorages/automation-core/blob/master/README.md),
- [Conclusion](https://github.com/CloudByteStorages/automation-core/blob/master/touchstone/DesignThoughts/My%20Final%20Thoughts.md)

I believe below projects have a chance to change the world of devops if applied correctly:

- [rally](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Rally)
- [itsabot](https://github.com/itsabot/abot/wiki/Building-a-Plugin)
- [operable](https://operable.io/)
- [pixie](https://github.com/pixie-lang/pixie)
- [lambdacd](https://github.com/flosell/lambdacd)
- [jepsen](https://github.com/aphyr/jepsen)
