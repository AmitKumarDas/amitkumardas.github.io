##  AMIT KUMAR DAS
Bangalore - 560103, Karnataka, India | C: (+91) 9972321496 | amitnist@gmail.com

I have elaborated my current profile which in turn matches the stated job description.

> I specialize in designing & building software solutions, improving them, or simply
> refactoring them to isolated but cohesive features communicating in harmony.

I am passionate about micro-frameworks and the way these libraries can be curried to 
achieve a greater purpose.

Currently designing solutions around the management pieces of file systems 
(read ZFS, OpenEBS based block storages) & finding suitable ways to orchestrate from
IaaS frameworks or containers (Jails, LXC, Docker, Runc, etc.). 

As part of my tools to implement software pieces, I use a variety of programming 
languages, libraries, tools as & when applicable. I am fascinated by functional 
languages and the novelty they provide while thinking through any software puzzle.
In short, I fulfill the role of a full stack / polygot programmer, designer & thinker.
