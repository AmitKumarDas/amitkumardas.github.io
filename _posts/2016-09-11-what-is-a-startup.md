## What is a startup ?

A place to let your thoughts run wild, collect them, control them & finally channelize them that
has a positive impact on the organization. It is your best chance of re-living your school sans 
teachers. You experiment, you learn and you grow. Note the emphasis on **you**.

<br />

A startup hires you so that you can show them right ways of doing things with your unique skillsets & thoughts.
However, you need to adapt with the company. In other words, your skillsets might need a tuning or tailoring to
provide the necessary push your startup needs. It is not uncommon, to notice a 360 degree change in your 
thought processes to be effective.

<br />

Learn about its business model, its unique selling point. It should be at your finger tips. You should live by it.
Keep constantly asking yourself the viability of this model. Share your thoughts bravely, every now & then on 
its effectiveness. It is the runway to the startup's future. It is again very common to have companies updating their 
business model often to remain valid.

<br />

Keep listing down the things that have worked & things that have not. Keep a list of items that are a source of 
painpoints in the org. Flaunt these lists all around your office premises. Once you have these lists in-grained in
your thoughts, I am sure you will have plans to tackle them as well. 

## What about the associated risks ?

If you are not willing to risk the unusual, you have to settle for the ordinary.
