title: What is a startup
---

> A place to let your thoughts run wild, control them & finally channelize them that has a positive impact
on the organization. It is your best chance of re-living your school sans teachers. You experiment,
learn and grow.

> A startup hires you so that you can show them right ways of doing things with your unique skillsets & thoughts.
You need to be always adaptive with its growth as well its slump.

> Learn about its business model, its unique selling point. Keep constantly asking yourself the viability of this
model. Share your thoughts bavely, every now & then on the current business model. It is the runway to the 
startup's future. It is very common to have companies updating their business model often to remain valid.
