Views on building an open datacenter specifications or contributing to one

Some references:

- [Literate Programming](https://youtu.be/Av0PQDVTP4A)
- [Manual on web](http://trentm.com/json/)
  - [Source Code Of Above](https://github.com/trentm/json/blob/master/docs/json.1.ronn)
- [Checked C Specs](https://github.com/Microsoft/checkedc/tree/master/spec/bounds_safety)

Summarized points:

```
- Specs will reside in source code repository.
  - It will be version controlled as well as automatically displayed as blogs.  
- Best references on writing specs
  - Refer to OpenStack
- Continuously learn & adapt from other datacenter implementations.
- e.g. Refer to:
  - OpenStack
  - Cloud Foundary
  - Hashicorp
  - Kubernetes
  - Swarm
  - Mesosphere
  - Cloud Haskell
  - **Erlang** (the language which alone can compete with above frameworks & libraries)
  - **Riak-Core** i.e. sugar on Erlang for easy distributed programming
```
