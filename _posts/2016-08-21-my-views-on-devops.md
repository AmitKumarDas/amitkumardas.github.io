## Useful thoughts on DevOps

- Do we understand our painpoints ?
- Can we prioritize our painpoints ?
- Will solving the prioritized painpoint give us the maximum ROI ?
- Does the entire dev team checkin the source code daily ?
- Does the source code checkin consist of unit test checkin ?
- Is master branch the stable branch ?
- Does the dev checkin into master branch daily ?
- Does the dev care about building components with Single Responsibility Principle ?
- Does the dev care about composition of components instead of coupling ?
- Are we version controlling the operations config, logic & design decisions ?
- Are we able to version control the workflow definition ?
- Does the devops automation architecture support multiple language ?
