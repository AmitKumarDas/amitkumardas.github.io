My observations using awk

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# NOTE - You get the power of functional programming.
# NOTE - Most of the logic gets built in a line, usually less than 80 characters.
# NOTE - You have the entire time in the world, to keep tuning.
# NOTE - The abundance of time can be channelized for testing.
# .. ever wanted to explore property based testing, concolic testing, etc.
# NOTE - You will love to explain the logic that conforms to **Literate Programming**.
# NOTE - Your lines of documentation vs. lines of logic ratio may be **3 : 1**.
